"Cars for sale"

As a new car sales startup, we need to build out the first version of our platform. Our users need to be able to see a list of the cars available, and search by model name, type (pickup truck, sedan, etc...), or newness.

## deliverables

1. The app must display a scrollable list of cars.
2. Cars in list must be implemented re-usably, and simply.
3. You must query a database for the list of cars. It doesn't need to be an active public API right now, just use seed data.
4. The user must be able to submit cars to the database through a controlled form.
5. The user must be able to search the list (responsively) with a controlled searchbox.

## Bonus

1. Ideally, the user can filter by model name, type, or newness, but it's not required for MVP.
2. Conditionally render an address form for the user to input their delivery address. It doesn't need to actually submit to a database yet.

## testing

No tests are required, but they'd be nice.
